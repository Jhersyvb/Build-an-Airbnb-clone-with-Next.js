    "description": "From the outside this house looks cozy. It has been built with oak wood and has marble decorations. Tall, wide windows let in plenty of light and have been added to the house in a fairly symmetrical pattern.<br> The house is equipped with a small kitchen and one large bathroom, it also has a warm living room, five bedrooms, a snug dining room, an office and a roomy garage. <br> The building is shaped like an L. The extension extends into stylish gardens circling around half the house. <br> The second floor is bigger than the first, which creates several overhanging parts on one side of the house. This floor follows the same style as the floor below. <br> The roof is high and rounded and is covered with brown wood shingles. One large chimney pokes out the center of the roof. Several long, thin windows let in plenty of light to the rooms below the roof. <br> The house itself is surrounded by a tranquil garden, with various flowers, a long pond including a small waterfall and various rock formations.",
